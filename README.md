# Diabetes-Predication-Project
This project focuses on building a robust and efficient machine learning system for the classification of diabetes types (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational) based on patient health data. By leveraging advanced algorithms and data-driven techniques, the system aims to enhance early detection, improve accuracy, and enable better healthcare outcomes.

The project is designed to address key challenges in diabetes diagnosis, such as time-consuming procedures, high costs, and misclassification, making it a valuable tool for both healthcare professionals and patients.
